### A Simple and Lightweight Music Player [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/andreldm/kissplayer.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/andreldm/kissplayer)

Cross-platform and open-source Music Player designed to be simple and lightweight.
If you want a player full of features, most of them you don't use, exaggerated eye-candy and a memory hog, take a look around , there are lots. However if you want a different player that doesn't distract you or wastes your time, KISS Player can be a great alternative.

As of now, it's alpha, usable, but lacks some minor features and needs more polishing. Suggestions and contributions are welcome.

Note: The name has nothing to do with the metal band or the act of kissing. It's an acronym for "Keep it simple, stupid" principle.

#### Download

- **Windows** - [download](https://github.com/andreldm/kissplayer/releases) the lastest release and extract.

#### How to build

[Check the project's wiki for instructions](https://github.com/andreldm/kissplayer/wiki/Building%20from%20source)

#### Translation
If you'd like to contribute and see KISS Player in your native language, please head over [Transifex](https://www.transifex.com/kissplayer/kissplayer).

#### Change the language
On Windows, there is an option for this under settings.<br/>
On Linux, check the current locale with the command: `locale`<br/>
Check [Arch's wiki](https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Locale#Setting_the_locale) for instructions on how to manage locales.

For CJK languages under Linux, due FLTK limitations, it is necessary to pass as argument the name of a font that supports CJK characters, i.e. `./kissplayer -f Code2000`.
